#KBContactsSelection
**KBContactsSelection** is a standalone UI and logic component that allows you to easily search and select contacts in your Address Book and redirect to Mail or Messages with results.

##Showcase
Notice elegant solution with phone numbers and emails and final redirect difference.

##Installation
**KBContactsSelection** is available via [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To use it simply add one line to your Podfile:

```
pod 'KBContactsSelection'
```

##Configuration
The public element of library is `KBContactsSelectionViewController` class. It contains one convenient method to create instance of itself with proper configuration:

```objective-c
+ (KBContactsSelectionViewController*)contactsSelectionViewControllerWithConfiguration:(void (^)(KBContactsSelectionConfiguration* configuration))configurationBlock;
```

It uses objective-c [Builder Pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern) adopted in elegant way with blocks usage. Inpiration for such solution was found [here](http://joris.kluivers.nl/blog/2014/04/08/the-builder-pattern-in-objective-c-foundation/).

`KBContactsSelectionViewController` is fullscreen view controller and it can be either pushed on navigation stack or presented.

`KBContactsSelectionConfiguration` class is responsinble for setting basic properties:

```objective-c
UIColor *tintColor;
enum KBContactsSelectionMode mode;
BOOL shouldShowNavigationBar;
```

**tintColor** is responsible for setting navigation bar `tintColor`, table view `sectionIndexColor` and search bar `tintColor`.

**mode** can be set to one of two enum values: `KBContactsSelectionModeMessages` or `KBContactsSelectionModeEmail`. They have impact on data displayed (emails or phone numbers) and final navigation (Messages or Mail app) for selected contacts.

**shouldShowNavigationBar** hides navigation bar from `KBContactsSelectionViewController` and should set when you push this view controller instead of presenting it.

##Usage
###Pushing KBContactsSelectionViewController with phone numbers

```objective-c
KBContactsSelectionViewController *vc = [KBContactsSelectionViewController contactsSelectionViewControllerWithConfiguration:^(KBContactsSelectionConfiguration *configuration) {
    configuration.mode = KBContactsSelectionModeMessages;
    configuration.shouldShowNavigationBar = NO;
    configuration.tintColor = [UIColor colorWithRed:11.0/255 green:211.0/255 blue:24.0/255 alpha:1];
}];

[self.navigationController pushViewController:vc animated:YES];
```

###Presenting KBContactsSelectionViewController with emails

```objective-c
KBContactsSelectionViewController *vc = [KBContactsSelectionViewController contactsSelectionViewControllerWithConfiguration:^(KBContactsSelectionConfiguration *configuration) {
    configuration.tintColor = [UIColor orangeColor];
    configuration.mode = KBContactsSelectionModeEmail;
}];

[self presentViewController:vc animated:YES completion:nil];
```

Each property of `KBContactsSelectionConfiguration` can be freely modified although it is advised not to hide navigation bar when presented and hide it when pushed.

##Example project
Example project can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/burczyk/KBContactsSelection).
Open `KBContactsSelectionExample.xcworkspace`, install all required dependencies by performing `pod install` and run the demo from gif above.

##Known issues
iOS Simulator obviously doesn't support messaging (proper alert) and apparently has some issues with presenting `MFMailComposeViewController`:

```
KBContactsSelectionExample[20027:5171733] _serviceViewControllerReady:error: Error Domain=_UIViewServiceErrorDomain Code=1 "The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. (_UIViewServiceErrorDomain error 1.)" UserInfo=0x7f95cae243f0 {Canceled=service continuation}
```

It works fine on real device but fails on Simulator which is probably a bug. Some StackOverflow threads regarding this issue can be found [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25604552/i-have-real-misunderstanding-with-mfmailcomposeviewcontroller-in-swift-ios8-in) and [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25604552/i-have-real-misunderstanding-with-mfmailcomposeviewcontroller-in-swift-ios8-in).

##Components
###KBContactsSelectionViewController
Is a main component of whole library and probably the only one you should explicitly use. For a convenience it has some self-describing public properties to tweak its behavior:

```objective-c
@property (weak, nonatomic) IBOutlet UITableView *tableView;
@property (weak, nonatomic) IBOutlet UISearchBar *searchBar;
@property (weak, nonatomic) IBOutlet UIBarButtonItem *buttonItemCancel;
@property (weak, nonatomic) IBOutlet UIBarButtonItem *buttonItemSelect;
@property (weak, nonatomic) IBOutlet UINavigationBar *navigationBarSearchContacts;
@property (weak, nonatomic) IBOutlet NSLayoutConstraint *navigationBarSearchContactsHeight;
```

It is responsible for most of user interactions: buttons, presenting final view controllers, search. 

Despite the fact that `KBContactsSelectionViewController` contains table view it doesn't act as its data source or delegate. It passes all responsibilities regarding table view to `KBContactsTableViewDataSource` component.

###KBContactsTableViewDataSource
Is an object that adopts two protocols: `<UITableViewDataSource, UITableViewDelegate>` and is fully responsible for rendering, filtering and capturing contacts in table view.

It starts with loading all contacts once and storing them in immutable array for performance reasons. Then it groups the contacts in a dictionary where keys are first letters of full name and values are sorted arrays of all contacts whose name starts with this letter.

Search is performed by creating a filtered copy of all contacts and grouping it like before.

All selected contacts are stored in separate array by `recordID` field so they are persisted between searches.

When `Select` button is pushed initial contacts array is filtered using all `recordIds` and proper view controller is displayed.

###KBContactsSelectionConfiguration
Was described in **Configuration** section.

##Localized strings
Library contains `NSLocalizedString` macro in proper places so you can generate `Localizable.strings` file with following literals:

```
"Messaging not supported" = "Messaging not supported";
"Messaging on this device is not supported." = "Messaging on this device is not supported.";
"OK" = "OK";
"Search contacts" = "Search contacts";
"Select" = "Select";
"Sending emails from this device is not supported." = "Sending emails from this device is not supported.";
```

**KBContactsSelection** uses [APAddressBook](https://github.com/Alterplay/APAddressBook) to easily manage iOS Address Book.
